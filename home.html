    <h1>Hello, It's <span>Sean</span></h1>
    <h3>I am a <span>Student</span></h3>
    <p>I'm just an ordinary student chasing a big dream. But unlike other student who wants their college life to be simple,<br>
       mine is not. I promise myself that I can get a part-time job as a <span>developer</span> at a tech company by second year or above,<br>
       that is why I always study everyday until I become a full stack developer. I know it is hard but I'm sure it is worth it.<br>

       I always kept in mind a quote by Zig Ziglar and Les Brown <q>You don't have to be <mark style="background-color: #b74b4b;">great to start</mark>, but you have to <mark style="background-color: #b74b4b;">start to be great</mark></q></p>
