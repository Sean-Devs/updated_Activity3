        <h1>AUTOBIOGRAPHY</h1>
     <hr> 
     <p class="paragraph">My <em>interest</em> in computers began in our family’s computer shop. 
        I wasn’t just a customer who used the machines—I was the one taking care of them. 
        From making sure the computers were running smoothly to fixing problems whenever they appeared,
        I slowly learned how each part worked. At first, it was challenging,
        but every time I solved an issue—whether it was a software error, a slow connection, 
        or a hardware problem—I felt proud. The shop became my training ground, and through those responsibilities,
        I developed not only my technical skills but also my patience and determination.<br>
        <br>As I grew older, my passion was further fueled by the people around me, especially my cousins.
        Many of them pursued careers in the IT industry and became successful in their respective fields.
        They would share stories about their projects, their challenges, 
        and the satisfaction they felt whenever they solved problems through technology. 
        Seeing their growth inspired me to follow the same path. 
        Their encouragement gave me the confidence to believe that I too could thrive in this field if I worked hard and stayed committed.<br>
        <br>Another strong influence came from social media. 
        Platforms like TikTok introduced me to people who made learning IT exciting and relatable.
        Among them, Gazi stood out the most. She is a Computer Science major, and through her content, 
        she didn’t just teach—she inspired.
        Seeing her passion and dedication to her field motivated me to work harder toward my own goals.
        Watching her videos, along with those of other IT professionals online, 
        made me realize how vast and dynamic this industry is. 
        Social media became a source of both knowledge and encouragement, 
        showing me that IT isn’t just a career—it’s a community where creativity, innovation, and growth never stop.<br>
        <br>In conclusion, my journey toward Information Technology has been shaped by experiences and inspirations that continue to strengthen my passion for the field.
        It began in our family’s <strong>computer shop</strong>, where I was not only exposed to computers but also entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining them. 
        Through countless hours of solving problems—whether it was repairing hardware, fixing software errors, or troubleshooting slow connections—I developed
        both technical skills and personal values such as patience, problem-solving, and determination. Those early challenges became my foundation,
        teaching me that persistence and curiosity are key to understanding technology. As I grew older, my cousins further deepened my interest by sharing their own 
        stories of success in the IT industry. Their experiences, from tackling complex projects to celebrating the satisfaction of finding solutions, inspired me to believe 
        that I too could build a meaningful future in this path if I committed myself fully.<br>
        <br>Beyond my personal circle, social media also played an important role in shaping my aspirations. Platforms like TikTok introduced me to professionals and students 
        who made learning IT both accessible and exciting. Among them, Gazi, a Computer Science major, stood out as a source of inspiration. Her dedication, passion, and willingness 
        to share knowledge showed me the value of hard work and creativity in this industry. Watching her and others reminded me that IT is not just about coding or fixing machines,
        but also about innovation, collaboration, and continuous learning. Altogether, these experiences—starting from my family’s shop, the encouragement of my cousins, and the
        motivation from online communities—have made me realize that IT is more than just a career choice. It is a lifelong journey, a dynamic community, and a passion that will continue
        to challenge and inspire me to grow, create, and contribute in ways that truly matter.</p>
